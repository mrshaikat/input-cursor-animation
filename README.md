# Animated Input Vite Project

This project demonstrates a custom animated input component built with React and Vite. The `AnimatedInput` component features a visually animated cursor that accurately tracks the user's input position, supporting both left-aligned and center-aligned text. The cursor is rendered independently for smooth animation and precise placement, even when moving the cursor with the mouse or keyboard, or when deleting characters.

## Features
- Animated custom input cursor
